-- =====================================================================
-- Moonshine Skins — 0004 Storage buckets and policies
--
-- Path convention, enforced by both the CHECK constraint on
-- skins.file_path and the policies below:
--
--   skins/<auth-user-uuid>/<skin-uuid>.txt
--   avatars/<auth-user-uuid>/avatar-<timestamp>.<ext>
--
-- The first path segment must equal the uploader's own user id, which is
-- what makes "you can only touch your own files" true at the storage layer.
-- =====================================================================
