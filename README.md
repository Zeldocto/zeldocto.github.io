My first experience coding.  
Will eventually add more tools as I think of them.  

## Tools  
### [IL Streak Counter](https://zeldocto.github.io/iltool/)
Keeps track of good/bad (self determined) times and streaks, shows success percentage, average time, and the best time of the session.
### [World Segment Calculator](https://zeldocto.github.io/worldcalc/)
Simple tool that adds together the sum of world segments of the standard any% route (for the best world segments total).
